      Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).
    </p>
    <p>
      Einstein is best known for his mass-energy equivalence formula E=mc², which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect and made significant contributions to the development of quantum mechanics.
